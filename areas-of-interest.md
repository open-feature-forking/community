# Member areas of interest

OpenFeature technical committee members, maintainers, and approvers
may list their areas of interest below, to help the community to find
good points of contact for topics of interest across the project.

Technical committee members are required to list these areas of
interest, and this is optional for maintainers and approvers.  These
listings may be useful to find an appropriate person to tag on an
issue, for example.

Members who are specifically employed by a company to contribute to
the OpenFeature project are recommended to list their company
affiliation, so that they may be contacted with vendor-specific
concerns.
